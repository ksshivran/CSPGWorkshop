## 3. Tutorial by Dr. Mital

This tutorial/laboratory practice is designed for individual completion on one's own device during the designated lab session. This setup has been validated for use on the Windows operating system. For this purpose, the following tools must be installed on the user's device:

1. **Wireshark**  
   A tool for network traffic sniffing, packet visualisation, and analysis.  
   Download: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

2. **ColaSoft PacketBuilder**  
   A GUI-based tool for editing and replaying network packets, allowing modification of raw packet header fields and payload.  
   This tool requires **Npcap** (https://npcap.com/#download) to be installed first.  
   Download: https://www.colasoft.com/packet_builder/

3. **Bit-Twist**  
   A simple but powerful command-line tool based on libpcap for packet editing and replay.  
   It does not require installation and can be run directly through the command window.  
   Download: https://bittwist.sourceforge.io/

4. **IED Scout (Omicron)**  
   A GUI-based tool functioning as an IED simulator. A 30-day trial version is available for download:  
   https://www.omicronenergy.com/en/products/iedscout/  

   It acts as an IED simulator and includes:
   - **Simulator Tab** – used to simulate the MMS server and the GOOSE publisher.  
   - **Browser Tab** – used to simulate the MMS client and the GOOSE subscriber.
